Dirty Love
Give me
Your dirty love
Like you might surrender
To some dragon in your dreams

Give me
Your dirty love
Like a pink donation
To the dragon in your dreams

I don't need your sweet devotion
I don't want your cheap emotion
Just whip me up some dragon lotion
For your dirty love

Give me
Your dirty love
Like some tacky little pamphlet
In your daddy's bottom drawer

Give me
Your dirty love
I don't believe you have ever seen
That book before

I don't need no consolation
I don't want your reservation
I only got one destination
An' that's your dirty love

Give me
Your dirty love
Just like your mama
Make her fuzzy poodle do

Give me
Your dirty love
The way your mama
Make that nasty poodle chew

I'll ignore your cheap aroma
And your little-bo-peep diploma
I'll just put you in a coma
With some dirty love

THE POODLE BITES!
(Come on, Frenchie)
THE POODLE CHEWS IT!
(Snap it!)
THE POODLE BITES!
(Come on, Frenchie)
THE POODLE CHEWS IT!
(Snap it!)

Hey there, people, I'm Bobby Brown
They say I'm the cutest boy in town
My car is fast, my teeth is shiney
I tell all the girls they can kiss my heinie
Here I am at a famous school
I'm dressin' sharp 'n' I'm actin' cool
I got a cheerleader here wants to help with my paper
Let her do all the work 'n' maybe later I'll rape her

Oh God I am the American dream
I do not think I'm too extreme
An' I'm a handsome sonofabitch
I'm gonna get a good job 'n' be real rich

(get a good
get a good
get a good
get a good job)

Women's Liberation
Came creepin' across the nation
I tell you people I was not ready
When I f**** this d**e by the name of Freddie
She made a little speech then,
Aw, she tried to make me say "when"
She had my b**** in a vice, but she left the d***
I guess it's still hooked on, but now it shoots too quick

Oh God I am the American dream
But now I smell like Vaseline
An' I'm a miserable sonofabitch
Am I a boy or a lady...I don't know which

(I wonder wonder
wonder wonder)

So I went out 'n' bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change, but I'm still kinda cute
Got a job doin' radio promo
An' none of the jocks can even tell I'm a homo
Eventually me 'n' a friend
Sorta drifted along into S&M
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
'Long as I gets a little golden shower

Oh God I am the American dream
With a spindle up my b*** till it makes me scream
An' I'll do anything to get ahead
I lay awake nights sayin', "Thank you, Fred!"
Oh God, oh God, I'm so fantastic!
Thanks to Freddie, I'm a sexual spastic
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now, I'm goin down,
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now, I'm goin down, etc.

Billy the Mountain
A regular picturesque
Postcardy mountain
Residing between lovely
Rosamond and Gorman
With his staning wife Ethel
A tree, a tree.

Billy was a Mountain
Ethel was a tree growing off of his shoulder
Billy was a Mountain
Billy was a Mountain
Ethel was a tree growing off of his shoulder
Ethel was a tree growing off of his shoulder
( Hey, hey, hey! )
Billy had two big
Caves for eyes
With a cliff for a jaw
That would go up or down
And whenever it did
He'd puff out some dust
And hack up a boulder, hack.
Hack up a boulder, hack, hack.
Hack up a boulder, hack, hack.
Hack up a boulder.

Now, one day, and I believe it was on Tuesday,
a man in checkered double-knit suit
drove up in large El Dorado Cadillac leased from Bob Spreene
( "Where the freeways meet in Downey!" )
and he laid a huge bulging envelope right at the corner of BILLY
THE MOUNTAIN, that was right where his foot was supposed to be.
Now BILLY THE MOUNTAIN, he couldn't believe it:
All those postcards he'd posed for, for all of those years,
and finally, now at last, his royalties!
"Royalties, royalties, royalties! The royalty check is in, honey!"
... Yes, BILLY THE MOUNTAIN was rich! Yes, and his eyeball caves,
they widened in amazement... and his jaw, which was a cliff, well
it ... it dropped thirty feet! A bunch of dust puffed out ...
rocks and boulders hacked up, hack! hack! ... crushing the Lincoln ...

I gave him the money
He acted real funny
He hacked up a rock and
It totaled my car
Oh do you
Know any trucks
Might be bound for the valley
I don't wanna stand here
All night in this bar
( Dear Lord )
I don't wanna stand here
All night in this bar
( No shit )
I don't wanna stand here
All night in this bar

By two o'clock, when bars had already closed down, Billy had broken the
big news to Ethel, AHHHH, and with dust and boulders everywhere, Billy,
choked with exitement, announced: "Ethel, we're going on a vacation!"...
Yes, and they were going on a vacation, oh, and Ethel, Ethel, Ethel, like
any little woman, she of course was very excited ... she creaked a little
bit, and some old birds flew off of her. Billy told Ethel they were going
to... yes, they where going to New York! "Ethel, we're going to...
New York!
But first they were gonna stop in Las Vegas...

"It's off to Las Vegas to check out the lounges,
Pull a few handles and drink a few beers, oh Ethel,
Ethel, my darling, you know that I love you,
I'm glad we could have a vacation this year,
Oh neat-o, glad we could have a vacation this year."

They left that night, crunchin' across the Mojave Desert,
their voices echoing thru the canyons of your minds...
"Ethel, wanna get a cuppa cawfee? Howard Johnson's, ahhh
there's a Howard Johnson's! ... Wanna eat some clams? ...

The first noteworhty piece of real estate they destroyed was Edwards Air
Force Base. And to this very day, wing-nuts and data reduction clerks
alike speak in reverent whispers about that fateful night when Test Stand
Number One and the rocket sled itself got LUNCHED, I said LUNCHED,
by a famous mountain and his small wooden wife ...

"Word just in to the KTTV news service undeniably links this mountain and
his wife to drug abuse and payoffs as part of San Joaquin Valley smut ring.
However, we can assure parents in the Southern California area that a
recent narcotic crackdown in Torrence ... Hawthorne ... Lomita ...
Westchester ... Playa del Rey ... Santa Monica ... Tujunga ... Sunland
... San Fernando ... Pacoima ... Sylmar ... Newhall ... Canoga Park ...
Palmdale ... Glendale ... Irwindale ... Rolling Hills ... Granada Hills
... Shadow Hills ... Cheviot Hills ... will provide the secret evidence
the Palmdale Grand Jury has needed to seek a criminal indictement and
pave the way for stiffer legislation, increased federal aid, and avert
a crippling strike of bartenders and veterinarians throughout the inland
empire ..."

Within the week, Jerry Lewis had hosted a telethon ( La La La nice lady )
to raise funds for the injured, "injured", and homeless, "homeless"
in Glendale, as Billy had just levelled it.
And a few miles right outside of town Billy caused a
'Oh mine/my(?) papa' in the earth's crust, right over the secret underground
dumps, right near the Jack In The Box on Glenoaks where they keep the pools
of old poison gas and obsolete germs bombs, just as a freak tornado cruised
through ... Yes, it was about three o'clock in the afternoon when little
Howard Kaplan was sitting on his porch ( "Toto...!") just playing
( "Come here, Toto ...!") and having a nice time with his little accordion,
("Toto...!") and this weird wind came up, direct from Glendale,
blowing those terrible germs in his direction ...
and all this caused by huge mountain
("Aunty Em") somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly,
sucking up two-thirds of it ( suck, suck, suck)
for an ultimetly dispersal over vast stretches of ... WATTS!!!

Now, unless I misunderstood, it was right outside of Columbus, Ohio
when Billy received his notice to report for his induction physical. Now
lemme tell ya, Ethel said, now Ethel, Ethel said she wasn't gonna let him
go ... "I'm not gonna let you go, Billy" ... that's right, we now have
confirmed reports from an informed Orange County minister that Ethel is
still an active communist and it is this reporter's opinion that she also
practices covent WITCH-CRAFT ...

It was about this time that the telephone rang inside of the secret
briefcase belonging to one mortal man who might be able to stop all of
this senseless destruction and save America herself. And I'm sorry to
disappoint some of you, it was not Chief Redden. This one man was
Studebacher Hoch, fantastic new super hero of the current economic slump.
Now, some folks say he looked like Zubin Mehta (Zubin Mehta);
still others say "Bullshit, honey, it was just another greasy guy
who happened to be born next to the frozen beef pies at Boney's Market...";
still others say "Pshaw/Shaun(?), and piss on you, Jack,
he's just a crazy Iatlian who drove a red car ..."
You see, nobody ever really knew for sure because Studebacher
was sooooo mysterious ....

He was so ( he was so, he was so) mysterious
He was so ( he was so, he was so) mysterious
'Cuz when a person gets to be such a hero, folks
And marvelouse beyond compute
You can never really tell about a guy like that
Whether he's really a nice person
Or if he just smiles a lot
Or if he has a son named Pinocchio or what.
Whether he's really a nice person
Or if he has a son named Pinocchio or what.
Some men say he could fly
Some men say he could swim
Others say he could sing like Neil Sedaka,
And all the girls in Flushing would be amazed of him
Two, three amazed of him ... amazed ...

Time passed. January, February, March, July, Wednesdey, August, Irwindale,
two-thirty in the afternoon, Sunday, Monday, Funny Cars, Walnuts, City of
Industry, Big John Masamanian ...
So when the phone ring in the secret briefcase, a
strong masculine hand with a Dudley Do-Right wristwatch and flexy braclet
grabbed it and answered in a deep, calmly assured voice: "So... ah...
yeah, yeah hello already ... what? ... well, yeah? ... Ah-are you kidding?
... You're not kidding ... a mountain ... with a tree growing off of its
shoulder? Aw, you're fulla shit, man... ah listen, by the way, before you
go on; did you get those white albums I sent ya with the pencil on the
front, yeah? Yeah, you should move some of those for me ... We're having
a lot of,...listen, so kiss little Jakee on the head... and how's your
wife's hemorrhoids?...ah, that's too bad...Listen...so you've got a
mountain, with a tree, listen, causing...well, let me write this down...
sorta take a few notes here...yeah? ...to El Segundo, huh?...causing
untold destruction..( my baby, my baby )...wanted for draft evasion?...
an expense account? ... and per diem, too?..."

SOME MEN SAY HE COULD DANCE
They said he could dance
And of course they were right ...

Ladies and gentelmen, this is it: The Studebacher Hoch
Dancing Lesson & Cosmic Prayer For Guidence, featuring Aynsley Dunbar!
... HIT IT! ...

Hey, right hand from a heart
Left hand from a heart
Right hand from a heart
Left hand from a left shoulder
To the heart. Fillmore, Fillmore ...
Nobody can dance like Studebacher Hoch ...
So many rumors have spread about Studebacher Hoch ... consider this
rumor which was published about three weeks ago in ROLLING STONE
( oh, it's gotta be true! ) ... Studebacher Hoch can write the Lord's
Prayer on the head of a pin!" (NO!) do-do-do do-do-doot doot do-do-do ...
... I'm so hip ... beef pies ... he was born next to the beef pies,
underneath Joni Mitchell's autographed picture, right beside Elliot
Robert's big bank book, next to the boat where Crosby flushed away all
his stash and the cops got him in the boat and drove away, to the can where
Neil Young slipped another disc ...

[ Frozen ??? pie
Frozen ??? pie
Frozen ??? pie
And that was the main influence on him
The influence of a frozen beef pie ]

Boldly springing into action he phoned his wife who ran a modeling school,
whereupon he... yes, he ran around the back of the Broadway at Hollywood
Boulevard and Vine to see if he could find himself some big, large,
unused cardboard boxes ( no shit! )... after which he hit up the Ralph's
on Sunset for some Aunt Jemima syrup, some Kaiser boiler foil and pair
of blunt sissors, yeah! ... yes, and in the parking lot of Ralph's ...
where no prices are lower prices than Ralph's... in the parking lot of
Ralph's, in between a pair of customized trucks where nobody was looking,
he cut out some really, really, really nice wings and he covered them
thoroughly with foil ...

Then he took those wings and wedged one under each of his powerful
arms and sneaked into a telephone booth ..YES,YES!! And then he shut the
fucking door! ... And he pulled down his blue denim policeman-type
trouser pants, and he spread even amounts of Aunt Jemima maple syrup all
over the inside of his legs! ... Soon the booth was filling with flies
( help me! help me! help me! ) ... He held open the legs of his boxer
shorts so they could all get in, and when each and every one of those
little cocksucking flies had gone into his pants and they were lapping up
all that maple syrup, he bent over and he put his head between his legs and
he said in a very clear, impressive, Ron-Hubbard-type voice: "New York"...
And the booth and everything lifted up, out of parking lot, and into
the sky.

Studebacher Hoch
YEAH, YEAH,
Studebacher Hoch
Studebacher Hoch
Studebacher Hoch
YEAH, YEAH,
Studebacher Hoch
Studebacher Hoch
He's coating his legs
With Aunt Jemima syrup up and down
His shorts will be filled with flies
That will be buzzing all around
Studebacher Hoch is really outa sight
Studebacher Hoch, he does it every night
Studebacher Hoch, he treats the flies all right
Studebacher Hoch
That's why they never bite, hey!

Hey please to New York
Fly to New York

He could be a dog
Or a frog
Or a lesbian queen
(Fly to New York)
He could be a narc
Or a lady marine
Or he might play dirty
He's over thirty
Getting old ...
I don't know
His peculiar attire
And the flies he requires
Keep leading him on
'Cuz Ethel is gone
They keep leading him on
'Cuz Ethel is gone
And the mountain she's on

And speaking of mountains - - we'll join Studebacher Hoch on the edge
of BILLY THE MOUNTAIN's mouth .. take it away! ...

"Ah ... ya, ya, ya, hey-ah, Billy, listen ... I've come to reason with you
... our great country needs you in the armed forces ... Your number came
up ... ya can't go on running like this forever ..."

Ah, but Ethel just shook her twigs angrily. But Studebacher Hoch, calm,
cool, collected and unperturbed, continued:

"Ya, well listen ... listen you communist sonofabitch ... you better get
your ass down there for your fuckin' physical or I'll see to it that you
get used for fill dirt in some impending New Jersey marsh reclamation ...
And your girlfiend there will wind up disguised as series of brooms,
primative ironing boards or a dog house ... get the ( cough, cough) get
the picture?"

Ya, well Billy just laughed:

"Ha, ha, ha. If they think they're gonna draft me, they're crazy."

Unfortunately, because Studebacher Hoch was standing on the edge of
BILLY THE MOUNTAIN's mouth when the giant mountain laughed ... Studebacher
Hoch lost his footing and fell screaming, two hundred feet into the
rubble below ... ( "Aaahhhhh, oh fuck, I'm gonna need a truss ...")

Ah listen, that only goes to show you
And it'l show you once again that
A mountain is something you don't wanna fuck with
You don't wanna fuck with
Don't fuck around
Don't fuck around
Don't fuck with Billy, No
And don't fuck with Ethel
You saw what just happened
To the guy with the flies

Don't fuck around
Don't fuck around
Don't fuck around
Don't fuck around
Don't fuck around
Don't fuck around
Don't fuck around
With Biddilly, Biddilly

Thank you, We'll be back.

Cosmik Debris
The mystery man came over
And he said "I'm outta sight!"
He said for a nominal service charge
I could reach nirvana tonight
If I was ready, willing and able
To pay him his regular fee
He would drop all the rest of
His pressing affairs and devote
His attention to me

But I said "Look here brother
who you jiving with that cosmik debris?
Now who you jiving with that cosmik debris?
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me"

The mystery man got nervous
And he fidget around a bit
He reached in the pocket of his mystery robe
And he whipped out a shaving kit
Now I thought it was a razor
And a can of foaming goo
But he told me right then when the top popped open
There was nothin' his box won't do
With the oil of Aphrodite, and the dust of the Grand Wazoo
He said "You might not believe this, little fella
But it'll cure your asthma too"

And I said "Look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris?
Now what kind of a guru are you, anyway?
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me"
*(Don't waste your time)*

"I've got troubles of my own", I said
"And you can't help me out
So, take your meditations and your preparations
And ram it up your snout!"
"But I got the crystal ball", he said
And held it to the ligh
So I snatched it, all away from him
And I showed him how to do it right

I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I looked like I was deep
I said some mumbo-jumbo, then
I told him he was going to sleep
I robbed his rings and pocketwatch
And everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future, then
As long as he was hanging around
I said "The price of meat has just gone up
And your old lady has just gone down!"

And I said "Look here brother-who you
Jiving with that cosmik debris?
Now is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho?
Don't you know, you could make more money as a butcher?
So, don't waste your time on me"
Don't waste it, don't waste your time on me

Bobby Brown Goes Down
Hey there, people, I'm Bobby Brown

Came creepin' all across the nation
I tell you people, I was not ready
When I fucked this dyke by the name of Freddie
She made a little speech then,
Aw, she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vice, but she left my dick
I guess it's still hooked on, but now it shoots too quick

Oh God I am the American dream,
But now I smell like Vaseline
An' I'm a miserable sonofabitch
Am I a boy or a lady...I don't know which

So I went out 'n' bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change, but I'm still kinda cute

And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now, I'm going down
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now, I'm going down

I knew you'd be surprised...

I couldn't say where she's coming' from,
But I just met a lady named Dinah-Moe Humm

She stroll on over, say look here, bum,
I got a forty dollar bill say you can't make me cum
(Y'jes can't do it)

She made a bet with her sister who's a little dumb
She could prove it any time all men was scum

I don't mind that she called me a bum,
But I knew right away she was really gonna cum
(So I got down to it)

I whipped off her bloomers'n stiffened my thumb
An' applied rotation on her sugar plum

I poked'n stroked till my wrist got numb
But I still didn't hear no Dinah-Moe Humm,
Dinah-Moe Humm

Dinah-Moe Humm
Dinah-Moe Humm
Where this Dinah-Moe
Comin' from
Done spent three hours
An' I ain't got a crumb
From the Dinah-Moe, Dinah-Moe, Dinah-Moe
From the Dinah-Moe Humm

I got a spot that gets me hot
But you ain't been to it
I got a spot that gets me hot
But you ain't been to it
I got a spot that gets me hot
But you ain't been to it
I got a spot that gets me hot
But you ain't been to it
'Cause I can't get into it
Unless I get out of it
An' I gotta get out of it
Before I get into it
'Cause I never get into it
Unless I get out of it
An' I gotta be out of it
To get myself into it

(She looked over at me with a glazed eye
And some bovine perspiration on her upper lip area
And she said...)

Just get me wasted
An' you're half-way there
'Cause if my mind's tore up
Then my body don't care

I rubbed my chinny-chin-chin
An' said my-my-my
What sort of thing
Might this lady get high upon?

I checked out her sister
Who was holdin' the bet
An' wondered what kind of trip
The young lady was on

The forty dollar bill didn't matter no more
When her sister got nekkid an' laid on the floor
She said Dinah-Moe might win the bet
But she could use a little ------- if I wasn't done yet

I told her...
Just because the sun
Want a place in the sky
No reason to assume
I wouldn't give her a try

So I pulled on her hair
Got her legs in the air
An' asked if she had any cooties on there

(Whaddya mean cooties! No cooties on me!)

She was buns-up kneelin'
BUNS UP!
I was wheelin' an dealin'
WHEELIN' AN' DEALIN' AN OOOOH!
She surrended to the feelin'
SHE SWEETLY SURRENDERED
An' she started in to squealin'

Dinah-Moe watched from the edge of the bed
With her lips just a-twitchin' an' her face gone red
Some drool rollin' down
From the edge of her chin
While she spied the condition
Her sister was in
She quivered 'n quaked
An' clutched at herself
While her sister made a joke
'Bout her mental health
'Till Dinah-Moe finally
Did give in
But I told her
All she really needed
Was some discipline...

Kiss my aura...Dora...
M-M-M...it's real angora
Would y'all like some more-a?
Right here on the flora?
An' how 'bout you, Fauna?
Y'wanna?

MMM...sound like y'might be chokin' on somethin'

Did you say you want some more?
Well, here's some more...

MMM, sure...listen
D'you think I could interest you
In a pair of zircon-encrusted tweezers?

MMM...tweezers!
Here, lemme sterilize 'em...
Gimme your lighter...

I couldn't say where she's coming' from,
But I just met a lady named Dinah-Moe Humm

She stroll on over, say look here, bum,
I got a forty dollar bill say you can't make me cum
(Y'jes can't do it)

I whipped off her bloomers'n stiffened my thumb

In the dark
Where all the fevers grow
Under the watah
Where the shark bubbles blow
In the morning
By your radio
Do the walls close in to suffocate, yah
You ain't got no friends
And all the others they hate, yah
Does the life you been leading gotta go? *(HMMmm?)*
*(Well let me straighten you out)*
About a place I know
*(Get your shoes and socks on people, it's right around the corner)*

Out through the night and the whispering breezes
To the place where they keep the imaginary diseases
Out through the night and the whispering breezes
To the place where they keep the imaginary diseases

*(This has got to be the disease for you
Now scientists call this disease, Brohm-a-drosis
But us regular folks, who might wear tennis shoes
or an occasional python boot,
know this exquisite little inconvenience by the name of
STINK-FOOT)*

You know
My python boot is too tight
I couldn't get it off last night
A week went by
And now it's July
I finally got it off
And my girlfriend cried, *YOU GOT STINK-FOOT!*
Stink-foot, darlin'

Your Stink-foot
Puts a hurt on my nose
Stink-foot, stink-foot, I ain't lyin'
Can you rinse it off, do you suppose?
*(Here Fido, Fido, mpt, mpt, mpt, come here little puppy
Bring the slippers
Arf, arf, arf
(C-R-A-S-H)
Huhm, HAH, HAH, HAH...hmhmhm)*
STINK!

*(Well then Fido got up off the floor, and he rolled over
and he looked me straight in the eye
And you know what he said?
"Once upon a time, somebody say to me"
This is the dog talkin' now
"What is your, conceptual, continuity?"
"Well I told 'em right then", Fido said
"It should be easy to see
"The crux of the biscuit
is the apostrophe"
Well you know, the man that was talking to the dog
looked at the dog, and he said
Sort of staring in disbelief
"You can't say that"
he said
"It doesn't, and you can't, I won't, and it don't
it hasn't, it isn't, it even ain't, and it shouldn't
it couldn't"
He told him, "No, no, no"
I told him, "Yes, yes, yes"
I said, "I do it all the time
Ain't this boogie a mess"?)*

The poodle bites, the poodle chews it

*(Well, right about that time people
A fur-trapper (who was strictly from commercial)
Had the unmitigated audacity to jump up from behind my igloo (peekaboo) )
And he started into whippin' on my favorite baby seal
With a lead-filled snowshoe)*

I said, with a
Lead-
Filled
With a lead filled snowshoe
He said, "Peekaboo"
I said, with a
Lead-
Filled
With a lead filled snowshoe
He said, "Peekaboo"
He went right upside the head of my favorite baby seal
he went "whap" with a lead-filled snowshoe, and
he hit him on the nose and hit him on the fin, and he
that got me just about as evil as an eskimo boy can be. So I bent down
and I reached down, and I scooped down and I gathered up a generous
mitten-ful of the deadly *YELLOW SNOW*

The deadly yellow snow, from right there where the huskies go!

Whereupon I proceeded to take that mittenful of the deadly yellow snow
crystals and rub it all into his beady little eyes with a vigorous
circular motion hitherto unknown to the people of this area, but destined
to take the place of the mudshark in your mythology
here it goes,the circular motion, now Rub It!

*(Here Fido)*

And then
In a fit of anger
I pounced

And I pounced again

Great Googly Moogly!

I jumped up and down on the chest of the him

I injured
The fur trapper

Well he was very upset, as you can understand
And rightly so, because the
Deadly yellow snow crystals had
Deprived him of his
Sight

And he stood up, and he looked around, and he said

"I can't see"
"I can't see"
"Oh, woe is me"
"I can't see"

"Well.....you know
I can't see
Nothin'"

"He took a dog-doo snow cone and stuffed it in my right eye
He took a dog-doo snow cone and stuffed it in my other eye
And the husky wee-wee
I mean the doggie wee-wee
Has blinded me
And I can't see
Temporarily"

Well, the fur-trapper stood there, with his arms outstretched across the
frozen white wasteland, trying to figure out what he was going to do about
his deflicted eyes. And it was at that precise moment that he remembered
and ancient Eskimo legend, wherein it is written (on whatever it is that
they write it on up there) that if anything bad ever happens to your eyes
as the result of some sort of conflict with anyone named
Nanook,
the only way you can get it fixed up is to go

Trudging across the tundra
Mile after mile
Trudging across the tundra

Right down to the parish of St. Alphonzo

Catholic Girls
A festive CYO Party with crepe paper streamers, contestants for the
broom dance, the "Hokey Pokey," baked goods, & FATHER RILEY making
sure the lights don't go down too low...

Father Riley And Various Party Goers:
Catholic Girls
With a tiny little mustache
Catholic Girls
Do you know how they go?
Catholic Girls
In the Rectory Basement
Father Riley's a fairy
But it don't bother Mary
Catholic Girls
At the CYO
Catholic Girls
Do you know how they go?
Catholic Girls
There can be no replacement
How do they go, after the show?

Joe:
All the way
That's the way they go
Every day
And none of their mamas ever seem to know
Hip-Hip-Hooray
For all the class they show
There's nothing like a Catholic Girl
At the CYO
When they learn to blow...

Father Riley:
They're learning to blow
All the Catholic Boys!

Mary:
Warren Cuccurullo...

Father Riley:
Catholic Boys!

Mary:
Kinda young, kinda WOW!

Father Riley:
Catholic Boys!

Mary:
Vinnie Colaiuta...

Chorus:
Where are they now?
Did they all take The Vow?

Father Riley:
Catholic Girls

Warren:
Carmenita Scarfone!

Father Riley:
Catholic Girls

Officer Butzis:
Hey! She gave me VD!

Father Riley:
Catholic Girls!

Warren:
Toni Carbone!

Chorus:
With a tongue like a cow
She could make you go WOW!

Joe:
VD vowdy vootie
Right away
That's the way they go
Every day
Whenever their mamas take them to a show
Matinee
Pass the popcorn please
There's nothing like a Catholic Girl
With her hand in the box
When she's on her knees

Larry:
She was on her knees,
My little Catholic Girl

Chorus:
In a little white dress
Catholic Girls
They never confess
Catholic Girls
I got one for a cousin
I love how they go
So send me a dozen
Catholic Girls
OOOOOOH!
Catholic Girls
OOOOOOH!
(etc.)

Central Scrutinizer:
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER...
Joe had a girl friend named Mary.
She used to go the church club every week.
They'd meet each other there
Hold hands
And think Pure Thoughts
But one night at the Social Club meeting
Mary didn't show up...
She was sucking cock backstage at The Armory
In order to get a pass
To see some big rock group for free...

I might be movin' to Montana soon
Just to raise me up a crop of
Dental Floss

Raisin' it up
Waxen it down
In a little white box
I can sell uptown

By myself I wouldn't
Have no boss,
But I'd be raisin' my lonely
Dental Floss

Raisin' my lonely
Dental Floss

Well I just might grow me some bees
But I'd leave the sweet stuff
For somebody else...but then, on the other hand I'd

Keep the wax
N' melt it down
Pluck some Floss
N' swish it aroun'

I'd have me a crop
An' it'd be on top (that's why I'M movin' to Montana)

Movin' to Montana soon
Gonna be a Dental Floss tycoon (yes I am)
Movin' to Montana soon
Gonna be a mennil-toss flykune

I'm pluckin' the ol'
Dennil Floss
That's growin' on the prairie
Pluckin' the floss!
I plucked all day an' all nite an' all
Afternoon...

I'm ridin' a small tiny hoss
(His name is MIGHTY LITTLE)
He's a good hoss
Even though
He's a bit dinky to strap a big saddle or
Blanket on anyway
He's a bit dinky to strap a big saddle or
Blanket on anyway
Any way

I'm pluckin' the ol'
Dennil Floss
Even if you think it is a little silly, folks
I don't care if you think it's silly, folks
I don't care if you think it's silly, folks

I'm gonna find me a horse
Just about this big
An' ride him all along the border line

With a
Pair of heavy-duty
Zircon-encrusted tweezers in my hand
Every other wrangler would say
I was mighty grand

By myself I wouldn't
Have no boss
But I'd be raisin' my lonely
Dental Floss

Raisin' my lonely
Dental Floss
Raisin' my lonely
Dental Floss

Well I might
Ride along the border
With my tweezers gleamin'
In the moon-lighty night

And then I'd
Get a cuppa cawfee
N' give my foot a push...
Just me 'n the pymgy pony
Over the Dennil Floss Bush

N' then I might just
Jumb back on
An' ride
Like a cowboy
Into the dawn to Montana

Movin' to Montana soon
(Yippy-Ty-O-Ty-Ay)
Movin' to Montana soon

*Hey! Do you know what you are?*
*You're an asshole! An ASSHOLE!*

Some of you might not agree
'Cause you probably likes a lot of misery
But think a while and you will see...
Broken hearts are for assholes
Broken hearts are for assholes
Are you an asshole?
Broken hearts are for assholes
Are you an asshole too?
Whatcha gonna do, 'cause you're an asshole...

Maybe you think you're a lonely guy
Maybe you think you're too tough to cry
So you went to *The Grape*,
Just to give it a try
And Dagmar
*Without a doubt, the ugliest sonofabitch I ever saw in my life*
Was his name...
*One Two Three Four!*
The whiskers sticking out from underneath of his
Pancake make-up
*And yet he was a beautiful lady*
Nearly drove you insane
*Let's talk about Leather: LEATHERRRRRR*
And so you kissed a little sailor
*Tex Abel, starring in the latest Shepperton Production:*
Who had just blew in from Spain
*Sir Richard Pump-A-Loaf*
You sniffed the reeking buns of Angel
*The story of a demented bread-boffer*
And acted like it was cocaine
*Cucumber pud annexed to a fine whole-wheat loaf*
You were dazzled by the exciting new costume of Ko-Ko
*Then on Tuesday night, Ceasar's back in town*
In a way you can't explain
*Facing off in a no-holds-barred tag team grudge match
With Kona.*
And so you worked the wall with Michael
*Three-hundred-seventy-nine pounds of Samoan dynamite*
Which gave your back an awful strain
*Volcanic Hell*
But you came back on Sunday for the gong show
*Next Thursday, teen town's finest...*
But you forgot what I was sayin'
'Cause you're an asshole, You're an asshole
That's right
You're an asshole, you're an asshole
Yes, yes
You're an asshole, you're an asshole
That's right
You're an asshole, you're an asshole

*Now you been to The Grape 'n' you been to The Chest*
*'N' now I think you know what you are: you're an asshole*

You say you can't live with what you been through
Well, ladies you can be an asshole too
You might pretend you ain't got one on the bottom of you,
But don't fool yerself girl
It's lookin' at you
Don't fool yerself girl
It's winkin' at you
Don't fool yerself girl
It's blinkin' at you
That's why I say
I'm gonna ram it, ram it, ram it
Ram it up yer poop chute
*Corn hole*
Ram it, ram it, ram it
Ram it up yer poop chute
*Fist fuck*
Ram it, ram it, ram it
Ram it up yer poop chute
*Wrist-watch; Crisco*
Ram it, ram it, ram it
Ram it up yer poop chute
*Pud!*

Don't fool yerself, girl
It's goin' right up yer poop chute
Don't fool yerself, girl
It's goin' right up yer poop chute
(etc., repeats)

*Aw, I knew you'd be surprised...*

Cocaine Decisions
Chop a line now...
Cocaine decisions...
You are a person with a snow-jon
You got a fancy gotta go job
Where the cocaine decisions that you make today
Will Mean that millions somewhere else
Will do it your way

Cocaine decisions...
You are a person who is high class
You are a person not in my class
And the cocaine decisions that you make today
Will mean nothing later on
When you get nose decay

I don't wanna know
'Bout the things that you pull
Outta your nose
Or where they goes
But if you are wasted
From the stuff you're stickin' in it
I get madder every day
'Cause what you do 'n' what you say
Affects my life in such a way
I learn to hate it every minute!

Cocaine decisions...
You are a doctor or a lawyer
You got an office with a foyer
And the cocaine decisions that you make today
Will not be discovered till it's over 'n' done
By the customers you hold at bay

Cocaine decisions...
You are a movie business guy
You got accountants who supply
The necessary figures
To determine when you fly
To Acapulco
Where all your friends go

Cocaine decisions...
We must watch the stuff you make
You have let us eat the cake
While your accountants tell you Yes Yes Yes
You make EXPENSIVE UGLINESS
(How do you do it? -- Let me guess...)
Cocaine decisions...
Cocaine decisions...
Cocaine decisions...

Whoa, are we moving too slow?
Have you seen us, Uncle Remus?
We look pretty sharp in these clothes, yes, we do
Unless we get sprayed with a hose

It ain't bad in the day
If they squirt it your way
'Cept in the winter, when it's froze
And it's hard if it hits, on your nose

Just keep your nose to the grindstone, they say
Will that redeem us, Uncle Remus?
I can't wait til my 'fro is full grown
I'll just throw away my doo-rag at home

I'll take a drive to Beverly hills just before dawn
And knock the little jockeys off the rich peoples lawn
And before they get up I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Before they get up, I'll be knocking the jockeys
Off the lawn, down in the dew

Shortly after his liaison with the taco stand lady, JOE makes a
horrible discovery...

Joe:
Why does it hurt when I pee?
Why does it hurt when I pee?
I don't want no doctor
To stick no needle in me
Why does it hurt when I pee?
I got it from the toilet seat
I got it from the toilet seat
It jumped right up
'N' grabbed my meat
Got it from the toilet seat
My balls feel like a pair of maracas
My balls feel like a pair of maracas
Oh God I probably got the
Gon-o-ka-ka-khackus!
My balls feel like a pair of maracas
Ai-ee-ai-ee-ahhhh!
Why does it
Why does it
Why does it
Why does it hurt...when I
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?

Central Scrutinizer:
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER...Joe has just worked himself into an imaginary frenzy during the fade- out of his imaginary song...He begins to feel depressed now. He knows the end is near. He has realized at last that imaginary guitar notes and imaginary vocals exist only in the imagination of The Imaginer...and... ultimately, who gives a fuck anyway...So...So... Excuse me...So...Who gives a fuck anyway? So he goes back to his ugly little room and quietly dreams his last imaginary guitar solo...

(after the song ends)
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER...As you can see, MUSIC can get you pretty fucked up...Take a tip from Joe, do like he did, hock your imaginary guitar and get a good job...Joe did, and he's a happy guy now, on the day shift at the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen, arrogantly twisting the sterile canvas snoot of a fully-charged icing anointment utensil. And every time a nice little muffin comes by on the belt, he poots forth...

And if this doesn't convince you that MUSIC causes BIG TROUBLE...then maybe I should turn off my plastic megaphone and sing the last song on the album in my regular voice...

Help I'm a rock, help I'm a rock, help I'm a rock!
Ahahahahahahaaa
Help I'm a rock, help I'm a rock, help I'm a rock!
Somebody, please, please!
Help I'm a rock, help I'm a rock...
Wow man, it's a drag being a rock
Help I'm a rock...
I wish I was anything but a rock
Heck, I'd even like to be a policeman
Hey, you know what, you know maybe if I practised, you know
Maybe if I passed my driving test
I could get a gig drivin' that bus and pick some freaks up
In front of Ben Franks, right!

Help I'm a cop, help I'm a cop, help I'm a cop!
(Help I'm a rock...), help I'm a cop, help I'm a cop!
It's a drag being a cop, I think I'd rather be the mayor
Always wondered what I was gonna be when I grew up, you know
Always wondered whether or not, whether or not I could make it,
You know, in society, because,
You know, it's a drag when you're rejected
So I tore the cover off a book of matches and I sent in
And I got this letter back that said, UHU, AHA

It can't happen here
It can't happen here
I'm telling you, my dear
That it can't happen here
Because I been checkin' it out, baby
I checked it out a couple a times, hmmmmmmmm
And I'm telling you
It can't happen here
Oh darling, it's important that you believe me
(Bop bop bop bop)
That it can't happen here

And they thought it couldn't happen here
(duh duh duh duh duh)
They knew it couldn't happen here
They were so sure it couldn't happen here
But...

Suzie...
Yes yes yes--I've always felt that
Yes I agree man, it really makes it...yeah...
It's a real THING, man
And it really makes it
(Makes it)

Suzie, you just got to town,
And we've been, we've been very interested
In your development.
Forget it!
Hmmmmmmmmm
